require 'faker'
# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
puts "Seeding the database..."

# Create a user
10.times do
  User.create!(
    email: Faker::Internet.email,
    password: Faker::Internet.password,
    first_name: Faker::Name.first_name,
    last_name: Faker::Name.last_name
  )
end

puts "Created #{User.count} users."


puts "Done seeding the database."
